# License-Plate-Blurring
Applying automatic plate blur using python (OpenCV).

Eastern European countries often use windshield cameras to register their routine in case of unusual situations, such as accidents. Due to that fact, they can provide large amounts of visual data that can be used as scientific material.

So, this project was able to use an classifier based on those databases to automatically blur russian car plates shown live on camera. Python was used as our main (and only) programming language, together with its libraries (OpenCV).
